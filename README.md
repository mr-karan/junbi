Junbi (準備), meaning "preparation" or "readiness" in Japanese, is a powerful and modular server setup and hardening tool. It's designed to quickly configure a secure, production-ready Ubuntu server with just a few commands.

## 🚀 Quick Start

To set up your server securely, follow these steps on your local machine:

1. Download the Junbi script:
   ```bash
   curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mr-karan/junbi/main/junbi.sh
   ```

2. Make the script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x junbi.sh
   ```

3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   ./junbi.sh
   ```

This script will guide you through the setup process, asking for necessary information about your remote server. It will then connect to your server and perform the hardening and setup tasks.

⚠️ Important: Run this script on your local machine, not on the remote server you want to configure.

⚠️ Always review scripts before running them with elevated privileges. You can inspect the script content with:

```bash
cat junbi.sh
```

## 🛠️ What Junbi Sets Up

- A new sudo user with SSH key authentication
- Hardened SSH configuration (no root login, no password authentication)
- Essential system packages (vim, curl, etc.)
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Optimized sysctl settings for better performance and security
- Unattended security updates

## 🔧 Requirements

- A fresh Ubuntu server (tested on 24.04 LTS and later)
- Root SSH access to the server

## 📚 Manual Setup

For those who prefer a step-by-step approach:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/mr-karan/junbi.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the Junbi directory:
   ```
   cd junbi
   ```
3. Run the setup script:
   ```
   ./junbi.sh
   ```
4. Follow the interactive prompts to customize your setup.

## 🛡️ Security Note

Junbi significantly improves your server's security posture, but it's not a silver bullet. Always follow security best practices, keep your systems updated, and regularly audit your server's configuration.
